## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Streamlit web application framework
- **Layout**: Wide layout with expandable sidebar for parameter controls
- **Visualization**: Plotly for interactive charts and Matplotlib for static plots
- **State Management**: Streamlit session state for maintaining model and data across interactions

### Backend Architecture
- **ML Implementation**: Custom linear regression model built from scratch using NumPy
- **Data Processing**: Pandas for data manipulation and NumPy for numerical computations
- **Model Training**: Gradient descent implementation with configurable hyperparameters

### Data Layer
- **Data Source**: Synthetic concrete dataset generation based on UCI concrete dataset structure

- **Target**: Concrete strength prediction
- **Data Generation**: Realistic sample data with proper feature ranges and noise simulation

## Key Components

### 1. Application Controller (`app.py`)
- Main Streamlit interface and user interaction logic
- Session state management for model persistence
- Integration of data loading, model training, and visualization components
- Hyperparameter controls via sidebar sliders

### 2. Data Management (`data_loader.py`)

- Gradient computation for weight updates
- Core mathematical operations for ML training

## Data Flow

1. **Data Generation**: Create synthetic concrete dataset with realistic feature distributions
2. **Data Preparation**: Extract features and target variables, normalize features using z-score
3. **Model Training**: Initialize weights randomly, iterate through gradient descent updates
4. **Prediction**: Use trained model to predict concrete strength for new inputs
5. **Visualization**: Display training progress, model performance, and prediction results

## External Dependencies
